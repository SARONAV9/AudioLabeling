# AudioLabeling

Script plays the audio files one by one, after playing each file waits for user input - ‘n’ (for noisy) or ‘c’ (for clean). Once the appropriate key is pressed 
proceeds to the next file. Once all the files are processed exports a json file with the file names and corresponding labels.

For running the script please install python3 and playsound using the following commands:

$ sudo apt install python3
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ sudo pip install playsound
